## <center>üìòüìò My Neovim Config </center>
#### <center>üôèüôèThanks for theniceboy's [neovim video](https://space.bilibili.com/13081489?from=search&seid=9375318644841322836) and [config files](https://github.com/theniceboy/nvim)!!

#### About This Config
* I began to use neovim about 1 year ago(2019), and now it's my **favourate** editor! I keep
learning and tuning neovim in the past one year; </br>

* Due to my study and work in Robotics, I usually code in C/C++ as well as Python. So if you 
  want to use (neo)vim as a lightweight IDE for C++ as well as Python, This config is **JUST FOR YOU!**

* Take whatever you want, but please **DO NOT** just clone it without skimming!</br>
</br>
