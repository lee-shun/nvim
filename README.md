## <center>üìòüìò My Neovim Config </center>

#### Ispired by: üåüüåü

* Theniceboy's [Neovim video](https://space.bilibili.com/13081489?from=search&seid=9375318644841322836) and [config files](https://github.com/theniceboy/nvim).

* Amix's  [ Ultimate vimrc](https://github.com/amix/vimrc).

#### About This Config
* I began to use neovim about 1 year ago(2019), and now it's my **favourate** ü•∞ editor! I keep
learning and tuning neovim in the past one year; </br>

* Due to my study and work in Robotics ü§ñ, I usually code in C/C++ as well as Python. So if you 
  want to use (neo)vim as a lightweight IDE for C++ as well as Python, This config is **JUST FOR YOU!**

* I strongly recommend to use **neovim rather than vim**. But if you have already fallen in love with vim,
and feel guilty to cheat behind her üòâ, at least make sure the vim version is above 8.2 to minimize the bugs while using the plugins.

* Take whatever you want, but please **DO NOT** ‚ùå just clone it without skimming!</br>

####  Main Features

* As **LESS remaps** as I can do to keep the original vim keybings;

* Different moduls are well arranged and separated;

* Use [coc.nvim](https://github.com/neoclide/coc.nvim) as the main platform;
